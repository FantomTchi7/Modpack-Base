All of the modpacks are inspired by [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) & [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive)!
> [!IMPORTANT]
>- As mentioned on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random) Faster Random requires a JVM that [fully supports Java 17's new `RandomGenerator` system](https://gist.github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/36719f1ed2770fa0094d6be618b137e3), **and implementations of the [LXM generators alongside it](https://openjdk.org/jeps/356)**. (example: [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)). **Having an unsupported JVM will cause crashes,** and will require you to use Faster Random 1.6.0. If your JVM doesn't support this, chances are it's not a good JVM.
>- On the topic of good JVM's, a good place to check them out & their best performance arguments is [brucethemoose's guide to JVM's arguments & benchmarks](https://github.com/brucethemoose/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks).
>- You can also check out [SO's wiki](https://github.com/HyperSoop/Simply-Optimized/wiki/Post%E2%80%90install) for some things you can do to get the most performance out of your game.
